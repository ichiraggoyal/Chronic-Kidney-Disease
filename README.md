# Chronic-Kidney-Disease
Chronic Kidney Disease also recognized as Chronic Renal Disease, is an uncharacteristic functioning of kidney or a failure of renal function expanding over a period of months or 
years. Habitually, chronic kidney disease is detected during the screening of people who are known to be in threat of kidney problems, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those with a blood relative chronic kidney disease (CKD) patient. So, the early prediction is necessary in combating the disease and to provide good treatment. This study proposes the use of machine learning techniques for CKD such as Random Forest technique, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree classifier. And Feature Selection Methods such as Correlation, Chi-square Test, Mutual Information, Fisherâ€™s Score, Mean Absolute Difference is used to obtain best features from the Data Set.  Final output predicts whether the person is having CKD or not by using a minimum number of features.
